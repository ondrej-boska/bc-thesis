abstract = {Ant System, the first Ant Colony Optimization algorithm, showed to be a viable method for attacking hard combinatorial optimization problems. Yet, its performance, when compared to more fine-tuned algorithms, was rather poor for large instances of traditional benchmark problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem. To show that Ant Colony Optimization algorithms could be good alternatives to existing algorithms for hard combinatorial optimization problems, recent research in this area has mainly focused on the development of algorithmic variants which achieve better performance than Ant System. In this paper, we present MAX–MIN Ant System (MMAS), an Ant Colony Optimization algorithm derived from Ant System. MMAS differs from Ant System in several important aspects, whose usefulness we demonstrate by means of an experimental study. Additionally, we relate one of the characteristics specific to MMAS — that of using a greedier search than Ant System — to results from the search space analysis of the combinatorial optimization problems attacked in this paper. Our computational results on the Traveling Salesman Problem and the Quadratic Assignment Problem show that MMAS is currently among the best performing algorithms for these problems.}

For solving this problem, this paper proposes a Beam-ACO algorithm, which is a hybrid method combining ant colony optimization with beam search. In general, Beam-ACO algorithms heavily rely on accurate and computationally inexpensive bounding information for differentiating between partial solutions. This work uses stochastic sampling as a useful alternative. An extensive experimental evaluation on seven benchmark sets from the literature shows that the proposed Beam-ACO algorithm is currently a state-of-the-art technique for the travelling salesman problem with time windows when travel-cost optimization is concerned.}

@phdthesis{darpmunk,
title = "Dial-a-Ride",
abstract = "The Dial-a-Ride problem is a Vehicle Routing problem in its most general form. The problem was formulated in the beginning of the 1970's and since then a large number of researchers have worked on developing efficient algorithms for use in automated planning of Dial-a-Ride transportation systems. In a Dial-a-Ride transportation system, passengers request a trip between two stops with either a desired time of departure from the pickup stop or a desired time of arrival at the destination. The time windows at the stops are then calculated by the operator based on additional parameters such as maximum excess ride time and allowed deviation from desired service time. All vehicles start and end at a depot, which can be different for each vehicle. The fleet of vehicles is heterogeneous meaning the vehicles can have a different capacity of passenger seats, wheelchairs and beds. The problem is then an extension of the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW) with the additional constraints that a pickup stop must precede a delivery stop for a passenger, and that both a pickup stop and a delivery stop related to the same passenger must be assigned to the same vehicle. The objective is to minimize the cost of operation similar to the objective for the CVRPTW, with the extension that the level of service to the passengers is considered. Several algorithms for solving the Dial-a-Ride problem have been proposed in the litterature. Because of the complexity of the Dial-a-Ride problem, most methods described in the litterature are based on various insertion techniques often coupled with some sort of clustering of stops, but since 1980 some experiments have been performed with dynamic programming, column generation and set partitioning. In recent years meta heuristics have also been applied to the problem. The metod used in this thesis is based on a clustering first insertion second technique developed at CRT in Canada in the mid 1980's. The algorithm is extended to include constraints imposed by a practical Dial-a-Ride problem at a Danish transportation operator. These constraints are mainly related to a generalization of capacity to include substitution of seats to wheelchairs and beds, but also extensions to the objective to give a better view of passenger comfort are included. To enable practical use of the algorithm, it is incorporated in the developed user interface and linked with a digitized road network. The user interface is developed as generically as possible making it reuseable in all sorts of Vehicle Routing problems. The foundation of the user interface is a database for storing customers, requests, routes etc. The digitized road map is included in the developed software by use of MapX, which is a program developed and sold by MapInfo Corporation. MapX handles the visualization of the map layers, selections, and labels. The road network is read from MapX into a different network structure in memory to allow for a more intelligent calculation of shortest path between stops and vehicle positions. Unfortunately data from actual Dial-a-Ride transportation systems is not readily available, so tests are based on data generated in this project. While the algorithm performs as expected, other results such as the stable performance of the different modules in the developed software and the developement of a practical setting for solving the Dial-a-Ride problem are equally important.",

Transportation is carried out by vehicles providing a shared service. The problem consists of designing a set of minimum-cost vehicle routes satisfying capacity, duration, time window, pairing, precedence, and ride-time constraints. This paper introduces a mixed-integer programming formulation of the problem and a branch-and-cut algorithm. The algorithm uses new valid inequalities for the dial-a-ride problem as well as known valid inequalities for the traveling salesman, the vehicle routing, and the pick-up and delivery problems. Computational experiments performed on randomly generated instances show that the proposed approach can be used to solve small to medium-size instances.}

abstract = {A heuristic algorithm is described for a time-constrained version of the advance-request, multi-vehicle, many-to-many Dial-A-Ride Problem (DARP). The time constraints consist of upper bounds on: (1) the amount of time by which the pick-up or delivery of a customer can deviate from the desired pick-up or delivery time; (2) the time that a customer can spend riding in a vehicle. The algorithm uses a sequential insertion procedure to assign customers to vehicles and to determine a time schedule of pick-ups and deliveries for each vehicle. A flexible objective function balances the cost of providing service with the customers' preferences for pick-up and delivery times close to those requested, and for short ride times. Computational experience with the algorithm is described, including a run with a real database of 2600 customers and some 20 simultaneously active vehicles. The scenario for the application of the algorithm is also discussed in detail.}

The first neighborhood class uses simple swap operations tailored to the dial-a-ride problem; the second neighborhood class is based on the ejection chain idea; and the third neighborhood class exploits the existence of arcs where the vehicle load is zero, giving rise to natural sequences of requests. We report new best results for 16 out of 20 benchmark instances.}

In addition to capacity and time window constraints, vehicle routes must also satisfy pairing and precedence constraints on pickups and deliveries. This paper introduces two new formulations for the PDPTW and the closely related dial-a-ride problem (DARP) in which a limit is imposed on the elapsed time between the pickup and the delivery of a request. Several families of valid inequalities are introduced to strengthen these two formulations. These inequalities are used within branch-and-cut algorithms which have been tested on several instance sets for both the PDPTW and the DARP. Instances with up to eight vehicles and 96 requests (194 nodes) have been solved to optimality. Keyword: pickup and delivery,branch-and-cut,time windows,valid inequalities",

These algorithms have considerably increased the size of VRPs that can be solved with respect to earlier approaches. Moreover, at least for the case in which the cost matrix is asymmetric, branch and bound algorithms still represent the state-of-the-art with respect to the exact solution. Computational results comparing the performance of different relaxations and algorithms on a set of benchmark instances are presented.
