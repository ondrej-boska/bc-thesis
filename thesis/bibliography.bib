abstract = {Ant System, the first Ant Colony Optimization algorithm, showed to be a viable method for attacking hard combinatorial optimization problems. Yet, its performance, when compared to more fine-tuned algorithms, was rather poor for large instances of traditional benchmark problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem. To show that Ant Colony Optimization algorithms could be good alternatives to existing algorithms for hard combinatorial optimization problems, recent research in this area has mainly focused on the development of algorithmic variants which achieve better performance than Ant System. In this paper, we present MAX–MIN Ant System (MMAS), an Ant Colony Optimization algorithm derived from Ant System. MMAS differs from Ant System in several important aspects, whose usefulness we demonstrate by means of an experimental study. Additionally, we relate one of the characteristics specific to MMAS — that of using a greedier search than Ant System — to results from the search space analysis of the combinatorial optimization problems attacked in this paper. Our computational results on the Traveling Salesman Problem and the Quadratic Assignment Problem show that MMAS is currently among the best performing algorithms for these problems.}

author = {Manuel López-Ibáñez and Christian Blum},
keywords = {Ant colony optimization, Travelling salesman problem with time windows, Hybridization},
abstract = {The travelling salesman problem with time windows is a difficult optimization problem that arises, for example, in logistics. This paper deals with the minimization of the travel-cost. For solving this problem, this paper proposes a Beam-ACO algorithm, which is a hybrid method combining ant colony optimization with beam search. In general, Beam-ACO algorithms heavily rely on accurate and computationally inexpensive bounding information for differentiating between partial solutions. This work uses stochastic sampling as a useful alternative. An extensive experimental evaluation on seven benchmark sets from the literature shows that the proposed Beam-ACO algorithm is currently a state-of-the-art technique for the travelling salesman problem with time windows when travel-cost optimization is concerned.}
